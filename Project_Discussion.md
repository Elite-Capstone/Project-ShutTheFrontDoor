# Elite-Project
Concordia 2020 Capstone Project

## Ideas and descriptions
1. Opus card app
  The app will allow the user to use the application on the cellphone instead of the Opus card. It will also allow the user to purchase tickets and monthly titles directly through the app. The card could find itself in the apple wallet. This will require access to the NFC of Apple and some feedback from the ARTM or one of its branches.
  
2. AI headgear detection
  The AI will be able to distinguish people wearing the required headgear for the location from people not wearing any. The AI will alert local authorities if the gear is mandatory. This will require Machine Learning, vision software (maybe a Matrox sponsorship??) and an big database of pictures/data. Legal issues might be of matter.
  
3. Hydrolic wall as a solution to residential floodings in Quebec
  The wall will be used to block the water from the flood from entering the protected residence. The wall will be moved/actuated by a system of motors/hydrolics and may be controlled with an IoT system. Such that the homeowner may decide to activate/deactivate the wall system. Automatic flood detection will be required to be entirely succesful. Information from Environment Canada could be used.
  
4. Aerogel for smarthome (expensive. 500$ for a 30cm x 30cm x 0.5cm)

5. IoT things using a prototype of downsized model house
  Using internet connectivity to connect different house components to a main hub or to your cellphone.

6. [Mobile app for Student Tutoring] (https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~eceweb/capstone/projectshow.php?id=497)
  From the page: On-demand mobile app for university students to find local study groups and tutors. Promotes local tutors with hands-on experience to find students in need of service, and vice-versa. Students are encouraged to sign up as tutors on the platform. Intends to offer its users full autonomy over schedule, rates, and teaching style.
  
7. [Tree Planting Robot] (https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~eceweb/capstone/projectshow.php?id=500)
  From the page: Significant robotic challenges: traversing over rugged terrain that includes rocks and fallen logs, identifying spots in the soil suitable for plunging a spade and inserting a sapling. This project will address these challenges through examination of responsive control of a locomotion system and tool insertion system. In the case of lack of lab access due to COVID, locomotion systems will be developed and tested in simulation, while other subsystems (graphical user interface, communications, digging tool) may be developed separately and integrated virtually online.
